### ripenet

Neural architecture search w/ weight sharing.

Effort made to make this as close to [ENAS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03268.pdf) as possible, but had to guess at some of the details.

This is active research code -- so there's no documentation, and it's very unstable.  Open issues w/ questions and I'll help as I can.

#### Dependencies

 - Python 3.6
 - Pytorch>=0.4 (installed from Github)
 - [basenet](https://github.com/bkj/basenet)
